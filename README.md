# ChopChop
The transition to college life brings unique challenges, particularly in maintaining a balanced diet amidst limited time, budgets, and resources. Many students struggle with meal planning, unhealthy eating habits, and food waste, which can lead to poor health and increased expenses.

ChopChop is a web-based application designed to help college students learn to manage their diets through tracking groceries (expiration alerts via SMS messaging, grocery list), cost of grocery visits, and exploring new recipes. The app provides a suite of features aimed at simplifying meal prep and grocery shopping, including:
1. ChopTrack: Auto receipt parser + receipt manager to keep track of groceries, SMS alerts for expiring ingredients, an interactive grocery list, and cost graph
2. ChopGuide: Suggests recipes based on dietary preferences.
